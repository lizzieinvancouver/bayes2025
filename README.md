# Who am I?

I am the repo Lizzie keeps most notes for her 3-week course on Bayesian stats.
See also: hotstatsdatasetsnmore2027/ for a prepped version of a repo to use if you're a student.

## Repos for the course (as of 2025)
* This one, which is for Lizzie to develop and maintain the course.
* bayesclassdatasetsnmore (see hotstatsdatasetsnmore2027/ for the 2027 prepped version) which is to share code with students
* homework repo (https://github.com/temporalecologylab/bayes2025homework currently) which is just a repo to share with students so they can upload their homework (could also do this on Piazza next time?)
