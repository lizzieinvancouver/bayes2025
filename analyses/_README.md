## Started 10 Apri 2025

Until 10 April 2025 this code was mostly in sandboxcode, but I moved it here because I was pretty sure I used in the course in January 2025
And on 10 April 2025 I tried to organize it so that there WAS one general graphs, input, output and stan folder, however, I did not always make sure all the paths were updated (though I tried for most stuff except homework1done/)

Also, I need to update a lot of my Stan code! 
Stan has updated and some of my code no longer will run because int[] y should become array[] int y

### Notes
* hierarchicalday2.R is hierarchicalday2startcode.R
