# Day to day ....

## Need to cover ...
- Don't use bar charts
- What is the posterior


## Maybe cover (if time allows)
- Counterfactuals


## Week 1 MUST cover (see homework) ...
- What is a parameter (how many in linear regression)
- What is n of data
- lm and stan_lm (quickly)
- What is an effect size?
- Students enrolled need to have me add them to the Git repo (and if they have better ideas of how I should do this in the future, they can tell me)

## Day 1
- What is Bayes (intro, including: equations, fac vs. obligate)
- Overview of workflow (on board)
- (After break) Simulate data together

Activities:
- Review a recent roject of yours: what parts of workflow did you follow or not? Which do you think matter the most?
- Simulating data!

## Day 2
- Priors! (in workflow)
- Show how data can overwhelm prior (and start to show output of model)
- Examples where priors matter (complete separation; Faith's model ... or review QUICKLY)
- (After break) Fit Stan (rstanarm) to yesterday's simulated data and compare output ... BONUS: Compare prior to your output

### Homework
- Simulate data and do a power analysis (don't say power analysis, but work up the basics of it with questions)
- Add an interaction to your simulated data and re-do the analyses
- Pick your sample dataset!

## Day 3
- Review homework!
- Fitting Stan to real data (in workflow)
- Manipulate posteriors
- (After break) Model evaluation metrics (Rhat, Neff, caterpillar plots)
- Pairs plots? Divergent transitions?

## Day 4
- Retrodictive checks (in workflow)
- (After break) You do retrodictive checks

### Homework
- Full workflow using your sample dataset!

## Day 5
- Review homework!
- Multi-level models and what are random effects
- Math of random effects
- (After break) Simulate data with random effects

## Day 6
- Forecasting with random effects

# Consider fitting in
- Sampler webpage (as activity)
- Similate logistic regression


# Need to find datasets!
- Check lme
- Olympic figure skating example?

## Need to cover (and have included in bayesnotes tex file)
- Many types of Bayesians (examples of Gelman vs. wildlife folks, versus DAG lovers etc. versus facultative)
- What is a `parameter` versus data
- How the class will run: active in class, do homework, grading etc.
- Different way to write a linear equation
- Logistic regression example (as a backup task, not in class lecture)
- Why use Bayesian? 
- Perils of using Bayesian vs Freq and intro to workflow for this reason (you build your own assumptions instead of memorizing them!)
