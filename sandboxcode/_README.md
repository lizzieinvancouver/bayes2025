In January 2025 I kept all the code here and moved it to bayesdatatsetsnmore2025 repo as needed. 
In April 2025 I moved what I was pretty sure was the code used in class into analyses/ 
The code remaining in here is probably a mix of stuff I never used (stdpredictors) and stuff where I extracted snippets into other code (e.g., olympics.R ends up a little in hierarchicalday2.R I)
