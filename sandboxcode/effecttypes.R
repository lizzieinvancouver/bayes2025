# Consider the two datasets (below) and report on the model you recommend fitting. 
# Would you fit a hierarchical model? Yes or no and why?
# If you would fit a hierarchical model, what exact type and why? Give the notation. 
# Once you finish that, fit the model and pull out the most relevant metric for the aim stated. 


# Dataset 1: Data on judges' scores for figure skaters across two programs: short and artistic. 
# Aim: You want to award an Olympic medal in figure skating to the best skater in the short program. 


# Dataset 2: You have gathered data on the day of various phenological events across diverse species, collected in different studies. 
# Aim: You want to best estimate the change over time in phenology across all species.
